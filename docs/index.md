[the <i>Pyright</i> PyCharm plugin][1].

The plugin runs and reroutes Pyright's diagnostics back to your IDE.
Both PyCharm Professional and PyCharm Community users can use it.


## Usage

given that you already [have Pyright installed][2].

After installing the plugin, return to your files
and start making some modifications.
You should see diagnostics from Pyright in a few seconds.
If not, refer to <i>[Problems and solutions][3]</i>.
