# Configurations

The plugin provides two configuration panels:

* <i>Pyright (Global)</i> for application-level settings, and
* <i>Pyright (Project)</i> for project-level settings.

They can be found under the <i>Tools</i> section of the <i>Settings</i> panel.

For the plugin to work, at least one [executable][1] needs to be specified.
Note that different [running modes][2] require different executables.

To configure highlight severity levels,
use [the inspection entry][3]'s corresponding pane.
