## [0.2.0] - 2024-04-17

### Added

* Three new properties are added to [`PyrightInspection`][20-1]
  to allow configuring highlight severity levels.
  [Corresponding documentation][20-2] is added.
  (0d6188f9, 25917886)

  (a8f6d5d6, 5cff663e)

## [0.1.0] - 2024-04-10

### Added

* [`LICENSE_TEMPLATE.txt`][10-1] is added. (e4b257e5)

### Changed

* `released.yaml` is renamed to [`publish.yml`][10-2].
  Steps overlapping with other jobs are removed. (aff01a5e)
* Default highlight severity levels are now the same as sister's. (5fccec40)
* The "Always use global" and "Auto-suggest executable" are moved back
  to the first column of the first row. (6e6c6df6)
* [@gradle/wrapper-validation-action][10-3] is updated to 2.1.3. (1c38c5ac)
* [The docs][10-4] are rewritten to reflect both plugins. (4d1f29b6, 5e997e73)

### Fixed

* [`PyrightConfigurable`][10-5]'s `apply()`, `isModified()` and `reset()`
  now call the corresponding methods of `panel`.
  This fixes a(nother) regression introduced in v0.1.0-mvp.5
  which has been causing the configuration panels to be unresetable. (2eb24204)

### Fixed

  [`PyrightConfigurable.isModified()`][6-6].
  This ensures that the state of panel is synchronized
  before being compared with the original state,
  which was not the case in v0.1.0-mvp.5. (6ac49d29)
* The test module `configuration2` is renamed to [`configuration`][6-7].
