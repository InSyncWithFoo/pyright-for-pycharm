<!-- Plugin description -->
Pyright integration for PyCharm.

This plugin runs [the Pyright type checker][1] on-the-fly
and reroutes its diagnostics back to the IDE as you code.

Warning: Depending on the running mode,
it might save your files at very fast pace.


## Usage

Go to <b>Settings</b> | <b>Tools</b> |
<b>Pyright (Global)</b> / <b>Pyright (Project)</b>
and set the path to your Pyright executable(s).

(Not sure what this means? See [the docs][3] for more information.)

Save, return to your file and start making some modifications.
You should see the annotations in a few seconds.

## Installation

This plugin [is available][8] on the Marketplace.
You can also download the ZIP files manually from [the <i>Releases</i> tab][9],
[the `build` branch][10] or [the <i>Actions</i> tab][11]
and follow the instructions described [here][12].

Currently supported versions:

## Credits

Most of the code is derived from [@koxudaxi/ruff-pycharm-plugin][13].
It is such a fortune that that plugin does almost the same thing
and is also written in Kotlin, and hence easily understandable.

The SVG and PNG logos are derived from [the README image][14]
of the [@microsoft/pyright][1] repository,
generated using Inkscape's autotrace feature.

Some other files are based on or copied directly from
[@JetBrains/intellij-platform-plugin-template][15].
