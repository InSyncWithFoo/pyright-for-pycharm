It requires a dependency on Node, which Python developers might not have on their development machines.</p> <p>The PyPI <code>pyright</code> package was created to solve this problem.

With the correct configurations, new versions may be automatically installed at runtime.</p> <p>If the corresponding version of the NPM package has not been installed, the proxies will also re-output the \"added 1 package\" notice by NPM, which will cause parsing errors.
